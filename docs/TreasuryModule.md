### onERC721Received

```solidity
function onERC721Received(address, address, uint256, bytes) external nonpayable returns (bytes4)
```



*See {IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received}. Always returns `IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received.selector`.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | address | undefined |

### proxiableUUID

```solidity
function proxiableUUID() external view returns (bytes32)
```



*Implementation of the ERC1822 {proxiableUUID} function. This returns the storage slot used by the implementation. It is used to validate that the this implementation remains valid after an upgrade. IMPORTANT: A proxy pointing at a proxiable contract should not be considered proxiable itself, because this risks bricking a proxy that upgrades to it, by delegating to itself until out of gas. Thus it is critical that this function revert if invoked through a proxy. This is guaranteed by the `notDelegated` modifier.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bytes32 | undefined |

### supportsInterface

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) external view returns (bool)
```

Returns whether a given interface ID is supported



#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| interfaceId | bytes4 | An interface ID bytes4 as defined by ERC-165 |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bool | bool Indicates whether the interface is supported |

### upgradeTo

```solidity
function upgradeTo(address newImplementation) external nonpayable
```



*Upgrade the implementation of the proxy to `newImplementation`. Calls {_authorizeUpgrade}. Emits an {Upgraded} event.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| newImplementation | address | undefined |

### upgradeToAndCall

```solidity
function upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes data) external payable
```



*Upgrade the implementation of the proxy to `newImplementation`, and subsequently execute the function call encoded in `data`. Calls {_authorizeUpgrade}. Emits an {Upgraded} event.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| newImplementation | address | undefined |
| data | bytes | undefined |
